❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND ❌

Your Python 3.13/3.14 is TOO NEW and has compatibility issues with numpy, PyTorch, and scipy on Windows.

The libraries hang when loading DLL files during import. This is a known issue with Python 3.13+.

=======================
SOLUTION: INSTALL PYTHON 3.11 or 3.10
=======================

1. Download Python 3.11.10 (RECOMMENDED) from:
   https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.10/python-3.11.10-amd64.exe
   
   OR Python 3.10.11 from:
   https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe

2. Install it (make sure to check "Add Python to PATH")

3. Open a NEW PowerShell window and verify:
   python --version
   (Should show "Python 3.11.x")

4. Then run:
   cd "c:\Users\Utsav\Desktop\New folder (2)\backend"
   if (Test-Path venv) { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force venv }
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Start backend:
   cd "c:\Users\Utsav\Desktop\New folder (2)\backend"
   venv\Scripts\activate
   python main.py

6. In another terminal, start frontend:
   cd "c:\Users\Utsav\Desktop\New folder (2)"
   npm run dev

=======================
WHY THIS HAPPENS
=======================

Python 3.14 was just released and compiled C extensions (numpy, scipy, pytorch) 
haven't been fully tested on Windows yet. DLL loading hangs at:
- numpy.linalg._umath_linalg
- scipy.linalg._fblas
- torch internal libraries

Python 3.11 is the stable, tested version that works perfectly with all ML libraries.

=======================
YOUR TRAINED MODELS
=======================

After fixing Python, place your trained model files here:
- backend/models/image_fault_classifier.pth (ResNet18 for fault classification)
- backend/models/hybrid_distance_regressor.pth (Hybrid CNN+metadata for distance)
- backend/models/meta_ct.joblib (ColumnTransformer for metadata preprocessing)

The system is fully coded and ready - just needs Python 3.11 to run!
